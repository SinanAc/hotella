# Hotella

## Hotel Booking Application

### Getting Started

Hello people, Hotella is a hotel room booking application created by using Flutter framework for frontend and collaborated with a backend developer who built the backend by using NodeJs. By completing this project I have learned more about user authentication, map integration, payment getaways and push notification using Firebase. The project is following MVVM architecture and using Provider as state management.
